# @zealforchange/conciseredux

## Install

`npm i @zealforchange/conciseredux`

or

`yarn add @zealforchange/conciseredux`

## Cause

- A `reducer` requires too much boilerplate `code`

- Need to create too many template-style folders

-There are too many `if` `else` `switch` in common `reducer`, which is ugly and not semantic enough

- I don't want to learn `redux toolkit`, just want to learn `redux and react-redux`

## Solved what?

- `reducer` is `actionHandler` and `dispatchHandler` **(createReducer API])**

- `reduce` unnecessary **updates** inside `redux`
